## Event Horizon - AIO FC2 Menu
* ImGui + DX11
* Requires Universe4 with FC2T enabled

### Todo
* <s>Optimize the nuts off this thing, it is so very slow.</s> 4x speed improvement in next update
* Make Teams, Steam, and Configuration functionality work (api request too big or something)
* Settings persistence (probably thru Lua configuration)
* <s>Clean this shit up, use structs/classes and add more functions & comments.</s> structs added, still can do with some work
* Change to Vulkan renderer for Linux support.
* Probably other stuff I'm not remembering.
